Like Thanos, [I am inevitable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSh_8GELo2w). And I make stuff perfectly balanced, as all things should be.

Big fan of [Taoism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoism) and especially [Wu Wei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_wei). I sail through life and achieve effortless excellence.

Rigid people are like bricks. Be better than them. [Be like water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JpIHeyUfVo) and make bricks sink in you.

Notice how most of the technology tries to turn humans into the machines instead of helping the humans being themselves. Isn't it completely backwards? Humans surely are weird creatures - constantly creating the tools of their own suffering.

Potentially available as a private life coach or just providing good vibes.
